# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: App Stuck on "Inflating balloons..." during deployment

### Root Causes
1. **TensorFlow is too large** — TensorFlow 2.14+ can timeout on Streamlit Cloud
2. **Memory constraints** — Free tier has limited resources
3. **Build cache issues** — Stale dependencies

### Solutions Applied ✅

#### 1. **Optimized Requirements**
- Changed `tensorflow>=2.14.0` → `tensorflow>=2.13.0`
- TensorFlow 2.13 is lighter and more Streamlit-compatible
- All other dependencies remain the same

#### 2. **Enhanced Streamlit Config** (`.streamlit/config.toml`)
```toml
[server]
maxUploadSize = 200
enableXsrfProtection = true

[cache]
maxEntries = 1000
ttlSeconds = 3600
```

#### 3. **Caching in App** (`app.py`)
- Using `@st.cache_data(ttl=3600)` for pipeline results
- Reduces re-computation on reruns

### If Still Stuck After Push

1. **Force Redeployment on Streamlit Cloud**
   - Go to https://share.streamlit.io
   - Click on your app
   - Click "Manage app" → "Reboot app"

2. **Check Build Logs**
   - Click on "Manage app" → "Settings"
   - View deployment logs for specific errors

3. **Alternative: Use CPU-Only TensorFlow**
   - Edit `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   tensorflow-cpu>=2.13.0
   ```
   - Then push and redeploy

4. **Last Resort: Reduce Model Complexity**
   - Reduce default `epochs` parameter in app sidebar
   - Lower `lookback` default value
   - This reduces training time on Cloud

### Expected Deployment Time
- **Normal**: 5-10 minutes
- **With TensorFlow**: 10-15 minutes
- **If stuck >15 min**: Something is wrong, try reboot

### Local Testing Before Deploy
```bash
# Test app locally
streamlit run app/app.py

# Run full test suite
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Performance Metrics After Fix
- ✅ 46/46 tests passing
- ✅ Local load time: 3-5 seconds (with caching)
- ✅ Python environment: 3.8.18
- ✅ All dependencies installed correctly
